Current plan:

Toggle switches to switch between A-1 and 2-9
Up: A B C D E F 0 1
Down: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Use 8-Way Rotary Selector Switch to select between values

Read signals in somehow... hmmmm

Every 2 minutes it saves the canvas as an image and wipes it - this is so that it doesn't crash my computer.
